The Vocata Logo
===============

Vocata’s logo reflects many of the concepts and assumptions established
above:

-  It is based on the triangles, the arrow, and the colors of the
   `ActivityPub <https://activitypub.rocks/>`__ logo
-  Two more colors from a derived palette have been added, to highlight
   that the Fediverse should be more colorful than some
   semi-interoperable, yet somewhat zoned platforms
-  Three triangles form a `Sierpinski
   triangle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle>`__,
   which is a fractal, much like the structure of the
   `ActivityPub <https://activitypub.rocks/>`__ social graph (global
   graph, instance sub-graph, and CBD transferred between them being
   three of its iterations)
